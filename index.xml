      <title>Categorizing Across Social Groups</title>
      <link>https://www.tatianalau.com/project/grouprep/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do we learn social group boundaries and actively categorize others? Previous research relied on explicitly labelled, static, single groups (e.g., team membership, race, etc.) and implied that group memberships are inferred via dyadic similarity to the agent (i.e., &amp;ldquo;How similar am I to John?&amp;rdquo; drives how we perceive John, and &amp;ldquo;How similar am I to Joan?&amp;rdquo; drives how we perceive Joan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to this, we use a generative model of latent structure learning and show that people integrate the relationships between all agents in the environment in addition to each agent&amp;rsquo;s dyadic similarity to themselves (i.e., &amp;ldquo;How similar am I to John?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;How similar am I to Joan?&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;in addition to&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;How similar are John and Joan?&amp;quot;) in order to infer the most probable latent group of people in the environment. These latent groups affect trait attributions made about agents and persist despite contradicting explicit group labels. Moreover, separate areas of the brain concurrently track latent structures and dyadic similarity. Taken together, this suggests that the process of understanding &amp;ldquo;us&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;them&amp;rdquo; is flexible and context-dependent in a way that can be captured by a latent structure model. Understanding the extent to which we rely on these latent groups may have implications for ways in which we could decrease intergroup bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, perhaps when we actively categorize in- and out-group members, we may rely on dyadic similarity, and this process may then be associated with regions of the brain commonly found in social cognition tasks, where participants reflect on the traits and preferences of themselves and close others. However, we find that active in-group categorization may instead rely on goal-oriented, domain-general networks in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Social Category Information Biases Affective Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://www.tatianalau.com/project/forecasting/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One part of interacting with others is being able to predict and anticipate their future emotional states—that is, make affective forecasts for them. For example, the way in which people classify interrogation methods as acceptable or as torture depends on their capacity to imagine the pain induced by such techniques. Typically, providing forecasters with more amounts of information can help them generate more accurate forecasts. Instead, we find that providing forecasters with targets’ group membership information causes them to make less accurate forecasts compared to when they have no such access to this information because they adjust in the wrong direction to account for this additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
