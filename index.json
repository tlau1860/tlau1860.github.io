Previous research relied on explicitly labeled, static groups (e.g., team membership, race, gender, etc.) and suggested that we infer others‚Äô group membership via dyadic similarity‚Äîspecific, static, salient features we share directly with others. In other words, ‚ÄúHow similar am I to Annie?‚Äù drives how we perceive Annie, and ‚ÄúHow similar am I to Betsy?‚Äù drives how we perceive Betsy, but ‚ÄúHow similar am I to Annie?‚Äù does not affect our perceptions of Betsy (Fig. 1a). Thus, sharing the same skin tone with another person may indicate in-group membership and their choices may influence our own choices. Dyadic similarity can also be found in other fields; basic spatial voting models suppose that voters select the political candidate with whom they directly agree the most. Similarly, social influence is frequently operationalized as propagating through the direct ties in large networks.\nFigure 1. (a) Dyadic similarity and (b) Latent group inference In contrast, we use a generative model of Bayesian latent structure learning, in which we glean information from the environment to infer the most probable latent group of people. We can integrate across the relationships between everyone in addition to how each each person relates to ourselves. Asking ‚ÄúHow similar am I to Betsy?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow similar am I to Annie?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow similar are Annie and Betsy?‚Äù drives how we perceive Annie and Betsy because they affect which latent groups (or structures) are inferred (Fig. 1b). Someone who is inferred as an in-group member in one context may be an out-group member in another context.\nThese latent groups affect trait attributions made about agents, and their effects persist despite explicit group labels that contradict the latent group. Moreover, separate areas of the brain concurrently track probabilities from the latent structure model and forms of dyadic similarity. In forthcoming work, we adapt the model into a novel, scalable framework to detect latent communities in large data sets that may otherwise be undetectable given current methods. We illustrate the framework‚Äôs utility by applying it to longitudinal mobility, communication, and friendship data observed from a large community over a nine-month period. Taken together, this suggests that the flexibility and context-dependent nature of understanding ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúthem‚Äù can be captured by a latent structure model. Reframing social groups as a form of latent group learning has implications for understanding and modelling intergroup processes, social influence, and choice behavior across different fields.\nYet, perhaps when we actively categorize in- and out-group members, we rely on dyadic similarity, and this process may then be associated with regions of the brain commonly associated with thinking about our own and similar/close others‚Äô states, traits, and characteristics. However, we find that active in-group categorization may instead rely on goal-oriented, domain-general networks in the brain.\nA recording of a seminar presentation covering some of this line of work can be found here.\n","date":1619481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619481600,"objectID":"f731ccc39e086649365e28098d3ba390","permalink":"https://tatianalau.com/project/grouprep/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/grouprep/","section":"project","summary":"In light of diversifying societies, how do we learn social group boundaries and categorize others into \\\"us\\\" and \\\"them\\\"?

One core component of this is social categorization‚Äîbeing able to recognize others as fellow in-group members or members of the out-group. Without this capacity, we would be unable to coordinate with in-group members or avoid out-group members. Past research in social psychology and cognitive neuroscience examining social categorization has suggested that one way to identify in-group members may be to directly compute the similarity between oneself and the target (dyadic similarity). This model, however, does not account for the fact that the group membership brought to bear is context-dependent. This review argues that a more comprehensive understanding of how we build representations of social categories (and the subsequent impact on our behaviours) must first expand our conceptualization of social categorization beyond simple dyadic similarity. Furthermore, a generalizable account of social categorization must also provide domain-general, quantitative predictions for us to test hypotheses about social categorization. Here, we introduce an alternative model‚Äîone in which we infer latent groups of people through latent structure learning. We examine experimental evidence for this account and discuss potential implications for understanding the political mind.","tags":"","title":"Reframing social categorization as latent structure learning for understanding political behaviour","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tatiana Lau","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Here, we use repetition suppression to examine the neural circuitry underlying generalized group categorization‚Äîthe process of categorizing in-group and out-group members across multiple social categories. Participants assigned to an arbitrary team (i.e., Eagles or Rattlers) underwent fMRI while categorizing political and arbitrary in-group and out-group members. We found that frontoparietal control network exhibited repetition suppression in response to \"identical in-group\" (Democrat-Democrat or Eagles-Eagles) and \"different in-group\" (Eagles-Democrat or Democrat-Eagles) trials relative to \"out-group/in-group\" trials (Republican-Democrat or Rattler-Eagles). Specifically, the repetition suppression contrast map included bilateral superior parietal lobule, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and bilateral middle temporal gyrus. Participants who reported an increased tendency to join and value their social groups exhibited decreased repetition suppression in bilateral DLPFC. Comparison of our whole-brain repetition suppression map with an independently identified map of frontoparietal control network revealed 34.3% overlap. Social categorization requires recognizing both a target's group membership but also the target's orientation toward one's self.

Evolutionary psychologists have argued that the human capacity for group affiliation is a byproduct of adaptations that evolved for tracking coalitions in general. These theories suggest that humans possess a common neural code for the concepts in-group and out-group, regardless of the category by which group boundaries are instantiated. The authors used multivoxel pattern analysis to identify the neural substrates of generalized group concept representations. They trained a classifier to encode how people represented the most basic instantiation of a specific social group (i.e., arbitrary teams created in the lab with no history of interaction or associated stereotypes) and tested how well the neural data decoded membership along an objectively orthogonal, real-world category (i.e., political parties). The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/middle cingulate cortex and anterior insula were associated with representing groups across multiple social categories. Restricting the analyses to these regions in a separate sample of participants performing an explicit categorization task, the authors replicated cross-categorization classification in anterior insula. Classification accuracy across categories was driven predominantly by the correct categorization of in-group targets, consistent with theories indicating in-group preference is more central than out-group derogation to group perception and cognition. These findings highlight the extent to which social group concepts rely on domain-general circuitry associated with encoding stimuli's functional significance.","tags":[],"title":"Decoding \"us\" and \"them\": Neural representations of generalized group concepts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tatiana Lau","Carey M.

In both political and sports contexts, forecasters across five experiments exhibited greater impact bias for both in-group and out-group members (e.g., a Democrat or Republican) than for unspecified targets when predicting experiencers' responses to positive and negative events. Inducing time pressure reduced the extremity of forecasts for group-labeled but not unspecified targets, which suggests that the increased impact bias was due to overcorrection for social-category information, not different intuitive predictions for identified targets.
