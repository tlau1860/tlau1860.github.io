One core component of this is social categorisation—being able to recognise others as fellow in-group members or members of the out-group. Without this capacity, we would be unable to coordinate with in-group members or avoid out-group members. Past research in social psychology and cognitive neuroscience examining social categorisation has suggested that one way to identify in-group members may be to directly compute the similarity between oneself and the target (dyadic similarity). This model, however, does not account for the fact that the group membership brought to bear is context-dependent. This review argues that a more comprehensive understanding of how we build representations of social categories (and the subsequent impact on our behaviours) must first expand our conceptualisation of social categorisation beyond simple dyadic similarity. Further, a generalisable account of social categorisation must also provide domain-general, quantitative predictions for us to test hypotheses about social categorisation. Here, we introduce an alternative model—one in which we infer latent groups of people through latent structure learning. We examine experimental evidence for this account and discuss potential implications for understanding the political mind.","tags":"","title":"Reframing Social Categorisation as Latent Structure Learning for Understanding Political Behaviour","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"How do we learn social group boundaries and actively categorize others?

These latent groups affect trait attributions made about agents and persist despite contradicting explicit group labels. Moreover, separate areas of the brain concurrently track latent structures and dyadic similarity. Taken together, this suggests that the process of understanding \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;them\u0026rdquo; is flexible and context-dependent in a way that can be captured by a latent structure model. Understanding the extent to which we rely on these latent groups may have implications for ways in which we could decrease intergroup bias.\nYet, perhaps when we actively categorize in- and out-group members, we may rely on dyadic similarity, and this process may then be associated with regions of the brain commonly found in social cognition tasks, where participants reflect on the traits and preferences of themselves and close others. However, we find that active in-group categorization may instead rely on goal-oriented, domain-general networks in the brain.\n","date":1603233821,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603233821,"objectID":"f731ccc39e086649365e28098d3ba390","permalink":"https://www.tatianalau.com/project/grouprep/","publishdate":"2020-10-20T23:43:41+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/grouprep/","section":"project","summary":"How do we learn social group boundaries and actively categorize others into \"us\" and \"them\"?

Here, we use repetition suppression to examine the neural circuitry underlying generalized group categorization—the process of categorizing in-group and out-group members across multiple social categories. Participants assigned to an arbitrary team (i.e., Eagles or Rattlers) underwent fMRI while categorizing political and arbitrary in-group and out-group members. We found that frontoparietal control network exhibited repetition suppression in response to \"identical in-group\" (Democrat-Democrat or Eagles-Eagles) and \"different in-group\" (Eagles-Democrat or Democrat-Eagles) trials relative to \"out-group/in-group\" trials (Republican-Democrat or Rattler-Eagles). Specifically, the repetition suppression contrast map included bilateral superior parietal lobule, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and bilateral middle temporal gyrus. Participants who reported an increased tendency to join and value their social groups exhibited decreased repetition suppression in bilateral DLPFC. Comparison of our whole-brain repetition suppression map with an independently identified map of frontoparietal control network revealed 34.3% overlap. Social categorization requires recognizing both a target's group membership but also the target's orientation toward one's self. Fittingly, we find that generalized social categorization engages a network that acts as a functional bridge between dorsal attentional (exogenously-oriented) and default mode (internally-oriented) networks.","tags":[],"title":"fMRI Repetition Suppression During Generalized Social Categorization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mina Cikara","Jay J.

Evolutionary psychologists have argued that the human capacity for group affiliation is a byproduct of adaptations that evolved for tracking coalitions in general. These theories suggest that humans possess a common neural code for the concepts in-group and out-group, regardless of the category by which group boundaries are instantiated. The authors used multivoxel pattern analysis to identify the neural substrates of generalized group concept representations. They trained a classifier to encode how people represented the most basic instantiation of a specific social group (i.e., arbitrary teams created in the lab with no history of interaction or associated stereotypes) and tested how well the neural data decoded membership along an objectively orthogonal, real-world category (i.e., political parties). The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/middle cingulate cortex and anterior insula were associated with representing groups across multiple social categories. Restricting the analyses to these regions in a separate sample of participants performing an explicit categorization task, the authors replicated cross-categorization classification in anterior insula. Classification accuracy across categories was driven predominantly by the correct categorization of in-group targets, consistent with theories indicating in-group preference is more central than out-group derogation to group perception and cognition.

Typically, correcting affective forecasts to include more relevant information improves their accuracy by reducing their extremity. In contrast, we found that providing affective forecasters with social-category information about their targets made their forecasts more extreme and therefore less accurate. In both political and sports contexts, forecasters across five experiments exhibited greater impact bias for both in-group and out-group members (e.g., a Democrat or Republican) than for unspecified targets when predicting experiencers' responses to positive and negative events. Inducing time pressure reduced the extremity of forecasts for group-labeled but not unspecified targets, which suggests that the increased impact bias was due to overcorrection for social-category information, not different intuitive predictions for identified targets.

One of the most intriguing phenomena in auction behavior is the winner’s curse—the strong tendency of participants to bid more than rational agent theory prescribes, often at a significant loss. The prevailing explanation suggests that humans have limited cognitive abilities that make estimating the correct bid difficult, if not impossible. Using a series of auction structures, we found that bidding approaches rational agent predictions when participants compete against a computer. However, the winner’s curse appears when participants compete against other humans, even when cognitive demands for the correct bidding strategy are removed. These results suggest the humans assign significant future value to victories over human but not over computer opponents even though such victories may incur immediate losses, and that this valuation anomaly is the origin of apparently irrational behavior.","tags":[],"title":"The Value of Victory: Social origins of the winner's curse in common value auctions","type":"publication"}]
