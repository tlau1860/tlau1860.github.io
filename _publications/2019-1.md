Humans form social coalitions in every society, yet we know littleabout how we learn and represent social group boundaries. We derive predictions from a computational model of latent structure learning to move beyond explicit category labels and interpersonal, or dyadicsimilarity as the sole inputs to social group representations. Using a model-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data, we find that separate areas correlate with dyadic similarity and latent structure learning. Trial-by-trial updating ofdyadic similarity between participants and each agent recruited medial prefrontal cortex/pregenual anterior cingulate (pgACC). Trial-by-trial latent structure updating, in contrast, recruited right anterior insula (rAI). Variabilityin the brain signal from rAI improved prediction of variability in ally-choice behavior, whereas variability from the pgACC did not. These results provide novel insights into the psychological and neural mechanisms by which people learn to distinguish "us" from "them".
