Welcome! I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/psychology/){:target="_blank"} at Royal Holloway, University of London. I completed my Ph.D. in 2019 working with [Mina Cikara](http://www.intergroupneurosciencelaboratory.com/){:target="_blank"} in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Harvard University, where I was also affiliated with the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I received my bachelor's degree from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu){:target="_blank"}, where I concentrated in economics with a minor in neuroscience and worked in the lab of [Jonathan Cohen](https://ncclab.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

Social groups and tribes provide immense benefits (e.g., social belonging, etc.) but incur great costs (e.g., intergroup conflict). Thus, understanding how social group memberships affect our actions and perception of the world may help us to best harness these two byproducts of social groups. 

To do this, I have employed a number of methods, including, but not limited to, in-lab experiments, online experiments, field experiments, and functional neuro-imaging (fMRI). 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in (i) how social group information affects our judgments and choice behavior towards others and (ii) how we understand who is and is not a member of our social groups in the first place (which can in turn affect our behavior towards others). 

You can find more detailed descriptions on my [Projects](/projects) page. Article pdfs and links to relevant OSF/GitHub repos can be found on my [Publications](/publications) page. Do get in touch if you have any questions.
